# COVID-19 in Italy



COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in Europe and especially in Italy. 

With the aim to monitor the evolution of the epidemic, we provide a code for fitting a statistical model based on   [publicly available data](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/).


The code is written in  [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) in order to make our research reproducible. 

The code can be easily run using [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) and requires a minimum knowledge of [R Software](https://www.r-project.org/).

We hope that our contribution will be appreciated and will help analyze data from other countries.
